        <h2>Simplifying Constitutional Law</h2>
        <p>
          Parts 5 and 6 of the Indian Constitution are pivotal in understanding the governance of India. Part 5 outlines the roles and powers of the
          Union government, including the President, Vice-President, and the Supreme Court, while Part 6 defines the state governments' structure,
          covering the Governor, State Legislature, and High Courts. Together, they form the foundation of Indiaâ€™s federal structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to simplify the complex language of these sections, making it accessible to everyone. Through interactive mind maps
          and quizzes, we break down dense legal concepts into engaging and understandable formats making them easy to understand for students,
          educators, and anyone interested in Indian governance.
